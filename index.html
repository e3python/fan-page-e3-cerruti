    <h3>Classroom Expectations</h3>
    <p>To maintain a safe learning environment, Griffins always keep their hands to themselves and respect the personal space of others. When we make mistakes, we are apologetic and take responsibility.</p>
    
    <p>We stay in our designated areas and ensure our ears are clear to hear instructions. By doing this, we show that we are ready to learn and grow.</p>
