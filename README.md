# 🎸 HTML Fan Page Mini-Project

**Welcome, Engineer!**
Today you are building a "Fan Page" for a topic of your choice (a band, game, sport, or food).

## 🎯 The Mission
Your goal is to build a well-structured page using **only HTML**. You will focus on hierarchy (titles vs. subtitles) and organizing data (lists).

## 📋 The Requirements
To get full points, your `index.html` file must have:
1.  **Main Title:** One `<h1>` tag at the top.
2.  **Sections:** Use `<h3>` tags for your "Bio" and "Details" headers.
3.  **Content:** At least 2 paragraphs `<p>` of text.
4.  **Data:** At least one List (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) with 3+ items.
5.  **Documentation:** You **MUST** use comments `<!-- -->` to label your sections.

## 🚫 The Constraints
* **NO CSS:** Do not use `<style>` or colors. We are building the skeleton today.
* **NO Images:** We haven't learned image paths yet. Use a text placeholder like `[ IMAGE GOES HERE ]`.

## 🚀 How to Start
1.  Open the file named [index.html](index.html) on the left side of your screen.
2.  Delete any sample code inside `<body>`.
3.  Start coding!
4.  To see your website, look for the "Go Live" or "Show Preview" button.
